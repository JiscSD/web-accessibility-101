structure, semantic html, landmarks

### Introduction

When you use HTML tags 'semantically', you use the word in a way that is properly aligned with the meaning of the word. The tag will have meaning in relation to the information inside it.  
For example, `<form>`, `<table>` and `<nav>` are semantic elements.  
But `<div>` and `<span>` are non-semantic elements.

Using Material UI as a component library means that components may be wrapped in excess div elements, so getting in Semantic HTML around these components will be really beneficial for the accessibility of your product.

From [React docs:](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html)  
Sometimes we break HTML semantics when we add `<div>` elements to our JSX to make our React code work, especially when working with lists (`<ol>`, `<ul>` and `<dl>`) and the HTML `<table>`. In these cases we should rather use React Fragments to group together multiple elements.
