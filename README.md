- [ ] Does the design have accessible colours? If not, have the colours been checked? (1)
- [ ] Is there only one H1 Heading present on each page? (2)
- [ ] Are the Heading tags in a logical order matching the structure? ยง2)
- [ ] Is semantic HTML used where possible? (2)
- [ ] Are ARIA attributes used if semantic HTML is not possible? (3)
- [ ] Do all images have descriptive alt text? (4)
- [ ] Does any visual/audio content have the option to pause? (4)
- [ ] If you have a navigation header, is a 'skip to main content' link present? (5)
- [ ] Are interactive attributes focusable, with obvious visible styling on focus? (5)

- [ ] Does your codebase have documentation in a README and comments where necessary?
